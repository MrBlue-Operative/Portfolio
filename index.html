            Checkmate Engine: The Chess AI
        </div><br>
        <div class="mainThing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I built a chess engine that plays the chess game with player, The Project was built in <span class="sp">Python</span> using <span class="sp" style="color: lime;">pygame</span> library. The game also contains AI powered by <span class="sp" style="color: red;">Minimax Algorithm</span> and <span class="sp" style="color: red;">alpha-beta Pruning</span>. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this project was to get grip on Python OOP as i was C++ main before that. The game has all basic set of rules along with adjustable depth searchinhg for AI. Implementation of OOP principles, evaluation function, move and applying principle and gameloop was also done purely using basic logic.

            DinoRL: Deep Q-Learning Agent for Chrome Dino Game
        </div><br>
        <div class="mainThing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             This was an insane Project that was build in <span class="sp">Python</span> using major Libraries like <span class="sp">Pytesseract, Pydirectinput, matplotlib</span> and some Deep Q learning libraries and dependencies like <span class="sp">DQN from stable base lines3</span>. The Project was built to teach chrome Dino game using reinforcement Learning. The outcomes were not the best due to lack of training but the overall Project was a success. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Agent made in this Project was trained locally for about <span class="sp" style="color: lime;">8 hours</span> and was able to achieve score of <span class="sp" style="color: lime;">297 points</span> in game while training. Obviously my system was slow and the training was also heavy, thats why i did not completed the training due to lack of powerful system.

        <div class="mainThing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             This Project is not really the most impressive thing for anyone, but for me it was the start of Machine Learning, The Project is just a combination of <span class="sp">TensorFlow</span> and usage of <span class="sp">Minist dataSet</span> to learn and train the first model of neural network and for experimental purposes by changing the numbers and observe the differences on the model.
